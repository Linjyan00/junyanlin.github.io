# About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/), working under the supervision of [Prof. Changwen Chen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=w2HXPUUAAAAJ) and [Dr. Xin Jin](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=byaSC-kAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). I am also a visiting student at the [Eastern Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.eias.ac.cn/) under the supervision of [Dr. Xiaoyu Shen](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=BWfPrE4AAAAJ).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on two main areas:

- **Multimodal Large Language Models**: Exploring how to effectively integrate visual and textual information in large language models, with particular emphasis on multi-layer visual feature fusion and connector architectures.

- **Multisource Remote Sensing Image Classification**: Developing advanced deep learning methods for processing and analyzing multi-source remote sensing data, including hyperspectral, SAR, and LiDAR imagery.

## Education

- **Ph.D. in Computer Science** (Expected Jun. 2029)  
  The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong, China

- **MPhil in Computer Science and Technology** (GPA: 3.82/4.0)  
  Ocean University of China, Qingdao, China (Sep. 2022 - Jun. 2025)

- **B.S. in Engineering** (GPA: 88/100, Rank: 1/68)
