abstract: "In the fusion process of multi-source remote sensing images, different emphasis may arise at different stages. Therefore, for the first time in the field of multi-source classification involving hyperspectral and radar imagery, we introduced the architecture of a dynamic network. Our proposed dynamic routing strategy and second-order feature interaction module have been empirically validated across multiple datasets, affirming their effectiveness."
