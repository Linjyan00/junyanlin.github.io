abstract: "Focusing on the architectural design of multimodal large language models, this paper categorizes connectors into feature-preserving and feature-compressing types and explores how each performs on tasks of varying perceptual granularity. Empirical evaluations span coarse-grained perception, fine-grained perception, and reasoning tasks from three comprehensive benchmarks."
