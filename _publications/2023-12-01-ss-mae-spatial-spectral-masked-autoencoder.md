abstract: "Attempting a dual-branch masked autoencoder for multi-source remote sensing image classification tasks, such as HSI, SAR, and LiDAR. The model focuses on separate mask reconstructions for spatial and spectral features. Outstanding performance across multiple datasets, along with the performance enhancement attributed to pre-training, validates the effectiveness of the MIM (Masked Autoencoder for Image Classification) self-supervised learning paradigm in multi-source remote sensing image classification tasks."
